/// - Springs for all movement — interruptible and retargetable with no hard
///   stops, so a mid-flight re-tap or auto-collapse redirects smoothly instead
///   of jumping. Disclosure reveals use `.smooth` (zero bounce): their content
///   is clipped while height animates, so any overshoot would visibly clip.
/// - One shared timing per element class, instead of per-call-site durations.
/// - Reduce Motion honored — SwiftUI does NOT do this automatically for
///   `withAnimation`/`.animation`. Animation tokens return `nil` (commit
///   instantly) and transitions degrade to a plain crossfade.
///
/// Views read `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` and pass it in.
