/// would forget a user's choice. Hoisting the toggle here under a stable id
/// preserves it across unmounts and navigation.
///
/// Only the user-set toggle lives here. The transient auto-collapse/auto-expand
/// *guards* stay as per-row `@State`: those transitions fire only while a turn
/// is generating, and the generating turn remains mounted as the active row.
///
/// Observation granularity: a tap invalidates every mounted row that read the
/// store (`O(visible)`), which is fine — taps are rare and human-paced. Reads
/// during streaming register dependencies but the store isn't written then, so
/// streaming causes no invalidation here.
